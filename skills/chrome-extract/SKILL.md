name: Slide Chrome Extract
description: >
  Extracts layout data from rendered HTML slides via Chrome headless — bounding
  boxes, colors, fonts, inline formatting. Use when elements are missing or
  mispositioned in the PPTX, when screenshots of HTML slides are needed, when
  debugging extraction issues, or when the conversion looks wrong and you need
  to check whether the problem is in extraction vs PPTX building. Start here
  before checking slide-pptx-builder.

# Chrome Layout Extraction

Drives Chrome headless to render HTML slides, injects JavaScript to walk the
DOM, and extracts **raw facts** — bounding boxes, computed styles, text runs,
and structural metadata. No classification decisions are made by the script.

## Two-Step Architecture

### Step 1: `extract_layout()` — Raw Facts from Chrome

Walks every visible DOM element and emits:
- `tag`, `classes`, `rect` (bounding box), `depth`
- `styles` (all computed CSS properties)
- `directText` (text nodes owned by this element, not children)
- `runs` (inline-formatted text with per-run color/font — only on true leaves)
- `hasBg`, `hasBorder`, `childElementCount`, `rotation`

No `type` field. No classification. Just browser-computed facts.

### Step 2: `classify_elements()` — Default Classification

Converts raw nodes into typed elements the builder expects:
- Nodes with `runs` → `type: 'richtext'`
- Nodes with `hasBg`/`hasBorder` and no text → `type: 'shape'`
- Tables → `type: 'table'`

This is the **deterministic default** for the 90% case. The model can override
any classification by looking at the HTML screenshot and the raw element list.

### When the Model Should Override

After the initial conversion, if a slide looks wrong, read the raw extraction
JSON. Common overrides:
- Element classified as richtext but it's a container → skip it
- Element classified as shape but it should have text → promote to richtext
- Element missing because it's a pseudo-element → adjust pseudo capture

## Core Functions

### `extract_layout(html_path, tmpdir, viewport_w, viewport_h, hide_selectors)`

Returns raw element tree:
```json
{
  "slideWidth": 1280, "slideHeight": 720,
  "slideBg": "rgb(10, 10, 15)",
  "elements": [
    {"tag": "div", "rect": {...}, "styles": {...}, "hasBg": true, "childElementCount": 3, "depth": 0},
    {"tag": "h1", "rect": {...}, "styles": {...}, "directText": "Title", "runs": [...], "depth": 1}
  ],
  "svgElements": [{"type": "svg", "rect": {...}, "lines": 45}]
}
```

### `classify_elements(raw_data)`

Applies default classification. Returns data in the format `pptx_builder` expects.

### `screenshot_html(html_path, png_path, ...)`

Full-page PNG screenshot via Chrome's `--screenshot` flag.

### `crop_region(full_png_path, out_path, region_rect, ...)`

Crop a region from a screenshot. Used for SVG chart extraction.

## Script Location

`scripts/chrome_extract.py` — imported by `slide-html-to-pptx`.

## Environment

Chrome path defaults to macOS location. Override with `CHROME_PATH` env var.

## JavaScript DOM Walker

The `JS_EXTRACT` constant walks every visible element and collects facts.
Key behaviors:

- Walks from `.slide` element (or `body` fallback)
- Coordinates relative to slide container, scaled to source dimensions
- `getRuns()` extracts inline-formatted text with per-run styles
- Only called on true leaf elements (no child elements)
- Tables extracted with full row/cell structure
- SVGs collected separately with line counts
- Pseudo-elements captured with geometry
- Max depth 15, skips script/style/nav/invisible

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Empty layout / null return | Chrome not found | Check `CHROME_PATH` |
| Elements missing | Hidden or too small | Check visibility and 1px minimum |
| Wrong positions | Viewport mismatch | Match `viewport_w`/`viewport_h` to HTML |
